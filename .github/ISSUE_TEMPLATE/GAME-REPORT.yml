        ## In-Game Settings

        <br/>

        Formatting notes for Display and Graphics settings:
        - Match the in-game format as closely as possible.
        - Use the styling buttons to add **bold** text and unordered lists for each in-game settings option.
        - Alternatively, use markdown for formatting:
            - Separate sections with level 4 headings (`####`).
            - Use bold labels (`**Setting Option Name:**`) for options.
        - If the game lacks "Display" or "Graphics" options, list resolution details under the **Display** section below.
        - If settings aren't separated, include all details under the **Display** section below.

        Example:
        ```
        #### Section
        - **Option1:** enabled
        ```

        ## Additional Notes

        <br/>

        You can use this section to add any extra details that may help others understand your report.

        ### Embedding a YouTube Video 🎥
        - If you include a **YouTube link** anywhere in this section, the website will automatically extract the video ID and embed the video at the bottom of the report.
        - Simply paste the full YouTube link Eg:
          ```
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcLv_kxtH94
          ```
          or
          ```
          https://youtu.be/fcLv_kxtH94
          ```
        - This is a great way to provide a visual demonstration of gameplay performance, settings, or issues.

        ### Using Shields.io Buttons 🛡️
        - If you prefer not to embed a video, consider using a **Shields.io button** instead.
        - Example of a **YouTube video button** in markdown:
          ```
          [![Video Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/Video%20Guide-FF0000?logo=youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcLv_kxtH94)
          ```
        - This creates a clickable badge that links to your video. If you wish to add tracking IDs to your YouTube link, this is the only option.
